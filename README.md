# DataWarehouse with BI and Dimensional Modeling Technique

## A data warehouse is the central repository of Information for your organization. Data warehouse helps organizations to support and manage business intelligent (BI) activities.  Data flows into the Data warehouse from the organization's operational system.


1. Extracted database from SAP, implemented data modeling technique to transform operational system data.
2. After transformation loaded data and used BI to gain some valuable insight.


In this project I have taken reference from: 

> The Data Warehouse Toolkit: Third Edition

## This project gave me valuable skills:
1. Regarding dimensional modeling and datawarehouse planning.
2. Kimball Lifecycle ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66699491/206959829-31894415-1dab-4faf-8b12-9d80d304691d.png)
3. Fact Table techniques- to identify facts based on business represntative requirement.
4. Dimension Modeling technique and slowly changing dimension attributes.
